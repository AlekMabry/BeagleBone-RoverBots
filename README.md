# BeagleBone-RoverBots
Code for rover-type beaglebone bots.

To the line tracker code works by taking the bottom slice of a video feed, then figures out with contours and image thresholding where the black line is located. The robot then turns either it's left wheel (P8 10) or right wheel (P9 11) accordingly.
